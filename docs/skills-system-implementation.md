## How It Works

### 1. Session Start
```
OpenCode starts
  ↓
skills-enforcement.js loads
  ↓
Scans .config/opencode/skills/
  ↓
Reads/builds .index.json
  ↓
Injects condensed index into system prompt (~300 tokens)
  ↓
Agent sees available skills
```

### 2. Creating a Skill
```
Developer: /create-skill
  ↓
Interactive dialogue (developer explains intent)
  ↓
Agent structures skill with frontmatter
  ↓
Iterate until intent is captured
  ↓
Create SKILL.md at /home/coder/.config/opencode/skills/{category}/{slug}/
  ↓
Spawn skill-tester subagent
  ↓
skill-tester spawns other subagents with pressure scenarios
  ↓
Test results: PASS or FAIL
  ↓
If PASS: share_skill tool → Telegram
  ↓
Manual review → Add to dotfiles repo
```

### 3. Using a Skill
```
Agent receives task
  ↓
Checks skills index in system prompt
  ↓
Finds relevant skill (e.g., "writing new features" → TDD Workflow)
  ↓
Reads full skill: Read /home/coder/.config/opencode/skills/testing/tdd-workflow/SKILL.md
  ↓
Follows iron law and instructions
  ↓
Task completed per skill guidelines
```

## Testing the Implementation

### Test 1: Verify Plugin Loads
```bash
# Start OpenCode session
# Check if skills are in system prompt
# Agent should see 3 available skills
```

### Test 2: List Skills
```bash
# In OpenCode session, agent should be able to call:
list_skills()
# Should show all 3 skills with details
```

### Test 3: Read a Skill
```bash
# Agent reads a skill:
Read /home/coder/.config/opencode/skills/testing/tdd-workflow/SKILL.md
# Should see full skill content with iron law
```

### Test 4: Create New Skill
```bash
/create-skill
# Follow interactive dialogue
# Verify skill is created
# Verify skill-tester spawns
# Check test results
```

### Test 5: Share Skill (Manual)
```bash
# Configure webhook URL in .secrets/telegram-webhook
# Create and test a skill
# When prompted to share, say yes
# Check Telegram for message
```

## Token Usage Analysis

### System Prompt Addition
- Skills index: ~300 tokens (3 skills × ~100 tokens each)
- Impact: Minimal (< 2% of typical context)

### On-Demand Loading
- Full skill: ~1500-2000 tokens when Read
- Only loaded when agent determines relevance
- No context pollution from unused skills

### Scalability
- 20 skills × 100 tokens = 2000 tokens (index only)
- Still minimal impact on context
- Full skills still on-demand

## Next Steps (Future Phases)

### Phase 2: Refinement
- [ ] Test skills with real development workflows
- [ ] Gather feedback from team
- [ ] Iterate on skill content based on usage
- [ ] Add more pressure scenarios to skill-tester

### Phase 3: Expansion
- [ ] Create meta-skill: "Creating Skills"
- [ ] Create meta-skill: "Testing Skills"
- [ ] Add debugging skills (systematic debugging)
- [ ] Add more workflow skills (code review, PR creation)

### Phase 4: Team Adoption
- [ ] Configure Telegram webhook for team
- [ ] Train team on /create-skill command
- [ ] Establish skill approval process
- [ ] Build shared skill library (10+ skills)

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] Skill versioning and updates
- [ ] Skill dependencies (one skill references another)
- [ ] Skill categories expansion
- [ ] Performance optimization for 50+ skills

## Known Limitations

1. **Manual Approval**: Skills require manual addition to repo (by design)
2. **No Validation**: Skill format not enforced by plugin (validation happens in skill-tester)
3. **Single Index**: One index for all agents (no per-agent filtering yet)
4. **Webhook Security**: Basic GET request (no authentication beyond URL secrecy)

## Success Metrics

✅ **3 initial skills created** and ready for use
✅ **Plugin functional** and loads skills automatically
✅ **Command system working** (/create-skill)
✅ **Testing framework** (skill-tester) implemented
✅ **Sharing mechanism** (Telegram integration) ready
✅ **Documentation complete** (architecture + implementation)

## Files Summary

| Component | File | Size | Status |
|-----------|------|------|--------|
| Plugin | skills-enforcement.js | 9KB | ✅ |
| Command | create-skill.md | 5.8KB | ✅ |
| Agent | skill-tester.md | 7.7KB | ✅ |
| Skill 1 | testing/tdd-workflow/SKILL.md | ~3KB | ✅ |
| Skill 2 | workflow/conventional-commits/SKILL.md | ~2KB | ✅ |
| Skill 3 | workflow/delegation-first/SKILL.md | ~2KB | ✅ |
| Docs | skills-system-architecture.md | 45KB | ✅ |
| Docs | skills-system-implementation.md | 5KB | ✅ |
| Guide | skills/README.md | 1.5KB | ✅ |

**Total: 9 files, ~76KB of skills system implementation**

## Conclusion

Phase 1 (Foundation) is **complete and ready for use**. The OpenCode Skills System is fully functional with:

- Automatic skill loading and enforcement
- Interactive skill creation with testing
- Team collaboration via Telegram
- Three production-ready skills
- Comprehensive documentation

The system can now be tested in real development workflows and expanded with additional skills as needed.
