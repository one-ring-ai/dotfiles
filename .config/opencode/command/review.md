# Review Changes

Perform a comprehensive review of repository changes against the standards outlined in `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`, ensuring compliance with code style, naming conventions, Docker standards, code best practices, API design and testing requirements.

## Initial Response

Acknowledge the review request by stating: "I'll review the repository changes for compliance with `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`. This includes checking code style, naming conventions, Docker standards, code best practices, API design, testing requirements, and commit message format."

## Preparation

1. Run `git status` to assess the current working tree state and identify staged/unstaged changes.
2. Run `git diff --stat` to get an overview of modified files and their change scope.
3. Determine the review target:
   - Default to the current working tree (staged and unstaged changes) unless the user specifies a commit ref, range, or branch.
   - If parameters are provided (e.g., a specific commit or range), use `git diff <ref>` or `git diff <range>` to focus the review.
4. Read `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` and `AGENTS.md` in full to understand all applicable standards.
5. If additional standards are referenced in the contributing guide (e.g., Docker or API design docs), read those as well.
6. If the review scope is ambiguous request clarification from the user before proceeding.

## Analysis Process

1. For each modified file, run `git diff --unified=0 <file>` to capture exact line numbers of changes.
2. Read the entire content of affected files using the Read tool when context is needed to evaluate compliance (e.g., for naming conventions or API design patterns).
3. Cross-reference changes against guidelines:
   - Code style (Bash, JavaScript, etc.) from CONTRIBUTING.md.
   - Naming conventions for files, functions, and variables.
   - Docker standards if applicable.
   - Code best practices, including no-comments policy.
   - API design principles.
   - Testing requirements.
   - Commit message format (conventional commits).
4. Maintain a Todo list via TodoWrite to track review subtasks, such as "Analyze file X for style violations" or "Check commit messages in range Y".

## Reporting Findings

1. Summarize overall compliance: State whether changes fully comply, partially comply, or have violations.
2. If violations are found:
   - Create a Markdown report file at `thoughts/shared/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-review.md` (append a short slug like `-api-changes` if multiple reviews occur on the same date).
   - Include YAML frontmatter with fields: `date` (current date), `reviewer` (agent name), `git_commit` (current HEAD or specified ref), `branch` (current branch), `topic` (brief description, e.g., "Code style and naming review"), and `status` (set to `in_review` initially).
   - Structure the report with:
     - A summary section recapping the review scope and overall findings.
     - A table or bulleted list of each violation, including: file path, line numbers, violated guideline reference (linking to CONTRIBUTING.md sections), and recommended fix.
   - Ensure all findings reference specific sections of `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` or other standards.
3. If no violations are detected, state "No violations of `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` were found in the reviewed changes" and do not create a review file.

## Final Response

Communicate results to the user:
- If a review report was created, provide a link to the file (e.g., `thoughts/shared/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-review.md`) and summarize key findings, highlighting any blocking issues that must be addressed before merging.
- If no issues were found, confirm compliance and note that no report was generated.
- Remind the user that this is a review-only process; no repository files were modified. If clarification is needed on scope or findings, request it explicitly.
